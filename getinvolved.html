            <h3> Stand With Refugees </h3>
            <p> More than 68.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, the largest number ever recorded. This global displacement crisis is made worse by countries closing their borders and turning their backs on the most vulnerable people. This is a humanitarian crisis, and it demands a more humane response.</p>
